    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Importance of collaboration in the industry and explores effective ways to collaborate in Computer Science.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Program Function & Purpose</h2>
        <p>Programs take inputs that affect behavior, and statements are executed following programming language rules.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Program Design & Development</h2>
        <p>New programs are expanded from existing ones and the use of comments/documentation helps with this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Identifying & Correcting Errors</h2>
        <p>Errors are natural in programming. Error types are: syntax, runtime, and overflow errors. There are ways to fix and test for these errors to ensure program functionality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Numbers as Bits</h2>
        <p>Numbers are used as a form of bits too for the display of information. A group of eight bits makes a byte. In the binary number system, only two numbers are used: <strong>"0"</strong> means off, while <strong>"1"</strong> means on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Compression of Pictures</h2>
        <p>With <strong>lossless data compression</strong>, there is always the ability to use fewer bits while ensuring that all the original data is still present. In <strong>lossy compression</strong>, bits are reduced greatly, but only some recessed forms of data are retained. Compression helps reduce the time to transmit information and saves space.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Data ETL</h2>
        <p>Managing data is not easy. Often, it may be disorganized, incomplete, or incorrect, which means you may have to consolidate data from multiple sources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Using Data Related Programs</h2>
        <p>Programs are used to process data, enabling users to gain knowledge. Programs can also be used to clean and filter digital data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Assignments and Variables</h2>
        <p>A program's abstraction for storing a value is called a variable. Variables in programming languages can refer to data types such as texts, lists, Booleans, and numbers. It is possible to update the values of variables. To give a variable a value, use the assignment operator "‚Üê".</p>
    </div>

    <h1><a href="https://youtu.be/oTIO-1clG70">Big Idea 4 Notes</a></h1>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>The Internet</h2>
        <p>The internet is a global network connecting devices using standard protocols. Data is transmitted in packets that travel independently and may take different routes. TCP ensures reliable data transmission, while IP assigns addresses and routes data. DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Fault Tolerance</h2>
        <p>Fault tolerance allows systems to continue operating despite failures. The internet is designed to reroute data if a connection fails, and redundancy improves reliability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Parallel and Distributed Computing</h2>
        <p>Parallel computing splits tasks among multiple processors for efficiency. Distributed computing involves multiple computers working together over a network to solve problems.</p>
    </div>

    <h1><a href="https://youtu.be/oTIO-1clG70">Big Idea 5 Notes</a></h1>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Beneficial and Harmful Effects</h2>
        <p>Computing has both positive and negative impacts. Benefits include improved communication, automation, and medical advances. Harms include privacy concerns, job loss, misinformation, and mental health effects.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Digital Divide</h2>
        <p>The digital divide is the gap between those with and without access to technology, caused by economic, geographic, or social factors. It affects education, job opportunities, and economic participation. Solutions include policies, nonprofit programs, and infrastructure development.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Computing Bias</h2>
        <p>Computing bias happens when algorithms favor certain groups unfairly. Examples include biased facial recognition and hiring algorithms. Solutions include diverse datasets, transparency, and ethical design.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Crowdsourcing</h2>
        <p>Crowdsourcing uses collective intelligence for problem-solving, such as Wikipedia and open-source software. It can improve efficiency but may spread misinformation if not monitored.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Legal and Ethical Concerns</h2>
        <p>Issues in computing include data privacy, intellectual property, and cybersecurity. Ethical concerns arise in AI, data collection, and software piracy. Ethical guidelines help ensure responsible technology use.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Safe Computing</h2>
        <p>Safe computing protects personal data and security. Best practices include strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and avoiding suspicious links.</p>
    </div>
