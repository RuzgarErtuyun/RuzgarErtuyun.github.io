    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Importance of collaboration in the industry and explores effective ways to collaborate in Computer Science.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Program Function & Purpose</h2>
        <p>Programs take inputs that affect behavior, and statements are executed following programming language rules.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Program Design & Development</h2>
        <p>New programs are expanded from existing ones and the use of comments/documentation helps with this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Identifying & Correcting Errors</h2>
        <p>Errors are natural in programming. Error types are: syntax, runtime, and overflow errors. There are ways to fix and test for these errors to ensure program functionality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Numbers as Bits</h2>
        <p>Numbers are used as a form of bits too for the display of information. A group of eight bits makes a byte. In the binary number system, only two numbers are used: <strong>"0"</strong> means off, while <strong>"1"</strong> means on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Compression of Pictures</h2>
        <p>With <strong>lossless data compression</strong>, there is always the ability to use fewer bits while ensuring that all the original data is still present. In <strong>lossy compression</strong>, bits are reduced greatly, but only some recessed forms of data are retained. Compression helps reduce the time to transmit information and saves space.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Data ETL</h2>
        <p>Managing data is not easy. Often, it may be disorganized, incomplete, or incorrect, which means you may have to consolidate data from multiple sources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Using Data Related Programs</h2>
        <p>Programs are used to process data, enabling users to gain knowledge. Programs can also be used to clean and filter digital data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Assignments and Variables</h2>
        <p>A program's abstraction for storing a value is called a variable. Variables in programming languages can refer to data types such as texts, lists, Booleans, and numbers. It is possible to update the values of variables. To give a variable a value, use the assignment operator "‚Üê".</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Abstraction of Data</h2>
        <p>An index is a way to use natural numbers to retrieve items in a string or list. The abstract characteristics of a data type are separated from its implementation specifics by data abstraction. Lists organize items, like strings or numbers, to form data abstraction. Data abstraction makes it easier to create and maintain programs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Mathematical Expressions</h2>
        <p>A finite set of steps used to complete a task is called an algorithm. Algorithms can be expressed in pseudocode, graphics, or natural language.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Strings</h2>
        <p>Code uses strings, which are collections of characters, to represent text. A segment of a string is called a substring. Names, words, and sentences are all strings that can be joined, divided, or searched.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Boolean Expressions</h2>
        <p>A value of true or false (or 1 and 0) is represented by a Boolean. AND, OR, and NOT are examples of Boolean operators. They are frequently utilized in loops and conditionals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Conditionals</h2>
        <p>Conditionals enable decision-making in programs based on specific conditions. They use if, else if, and else to execute different actions depending on whether conditions are true or false.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Nested Conditionals</h2>
        <p>Conditionals inside conditionals are called nested conditionals. By incorporating extra conditions, they manage more intricate choices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Iteration</h2>
        <p>An iteration occurs when a portion of an algorithm is repeated until a condition is satisfied or for a predetermined number of times. Program flow is managed using iterative statements, which repeat operations until a halting condition is met. The body of a REPEAT UNTIL(condition) loop does not run if the condition is initially true.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Constructing Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Algorithms can be updated from earlier algorithms, built from concepts, or integrated from preexisting ones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>Lists can be manipulated using processes and list indexing. Write iteration statements for list-based algorithms to process each item in the list.</p>
        <p>There are basic operations you can perform on a list: access an element by index, assign the value of an element to a variable, insert or remove elements, and determine the length of the list. You can traverse through a list either completely or partially.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Binary Search</h2>
        <p>Binary search algorithms eliminate half the data with each round of splitting. Data must first be sorted to use a binary search method.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Calling Procedures</h2>
        <p>Use procedures to execute the same instructions without rewriting the code. Procedures often require parameters and are called with arguments. Once a procedure terminates, the program continues from where it was called.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Developing Procedures</h2>
        <p>Procedures allow solving large problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems. Procedural abstraction enables programmers to modify or fix procedures without affecting the entire program.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Libraries</h2>
        <p>Libraries provide pre-written code that can be imported to create new programs. APIs explain how to use the procedures in a library.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Random Values</h2>
        <p>Random number generation in a program can yield different results every time it is run.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Simulations</h2>
        <p>Simulations simplify complex objects or events to investigate real-world scenarios. They may omit details and carry a risk of oversimplification or bias based on creator choices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Algorithmic Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Efficiency is determined by how often statements execute. Algorithms with polynomial efficiency or lower are considered reasonable, while those with exponential efficiency are not. Approximate solutions using heuristics may be required for certain problems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Undecidable Problems</h2>
        <p>An undecidable problem can be solved for some cases, but no algorithm exists to solve it in all cases.</p>
    </div>
