    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Importance of collaboration in the industry and explores effective ways to collaborate in Computer Science.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Program Function & Purpose</h2>
        <p>Programs take inputs that affect behavior, and statements are executed following programming language rules.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Program Design & Development</h2>
        <p>New programs are expanded from existing ones and the use of comments/documentation helps with this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Identifying & Correcting Errors</h2>
        <p>Errors are natural in programming. Error types are: syntax, runtime, and overflow errors. There are ways to fix and test for these errors to ensure program functionality.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Numbers as Bits</h2>
        <p>Numbers are used as a form of bits too for the display of information. A group of eight bits makes a byte. In the binary number system, only two numbers are used: <strong>"0"</strong> means off, while <strong>"1"</strong> means on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Compression of Pictures</h2>
        <p>With <strong>lossless data compression</strong>, there is always the ability to use fewer bits while ensuring that all the original data is still present. In <strong>lossy compression</strong>, bits are reduced greatly, but only some recessed forms of data are retained. Compression helps reduce the time to transmit information and saves space.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Data ETL</h2>
        <p>Managing data is not easy. Often, it may be disorganized, incomplete, or incorrect, which means you may have to consolidate data from multiple sources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Using Data Related Programs</h2>
        <p>Programs are used to process data, enabling users to gain knowledge. Programs can also be used to clean and filter digital data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Variables and Assignments</h2>
        <p>A variable is something used within a program to store values. Data types like numbers, Booleans, lists, and strings are referenced through variables. The value of a variable can be updated.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Data Abstraction</h2>
        <p>Data Abstraction is using lists instead of multiple variables to simplify coding. and index is a certain value in the list for example if i have a list with elements apple, pear and mango, apple is index 1</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Mathematical Expressions</h2>
        <p>An algorithm is a set of steps designed to solve a task. Algorithms can be described by using natural language, diagrams, or pseudocode.</p>
