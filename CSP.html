        <h2>Numbers as Bits</h2>
        <p>Numbers are used as a form of bits too for the display of information. A group of eight bits makes a byte. As for the binary number system, only two numbers are used: <strong>"0"</strong> means an off-computer, while <strong>"1"</strong> means on-computer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Compression of Pictures</h2>
        <p>With <strong>lossless data compression</strong>, there is always the ability to use fewer bits while ensuring that all the original data is still present. In the case of <strong>lossy compression</strong>, the bits are reduced to a great extent, but only some recessed forms of data are retained. Compression helps reduce the time taken to transmit information over the browser and saves more space.</p>

        <h2>Data ETL</h2>
        <p>Managing data is not easy. Often, it may be disorganized, incomplete, or incorrect, which means you may have to consolidate data from multiple sources.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>Using Data Related Programs</h2>
        <p>Programs are used to process data, enabling the users to gain knowledge. Programs can also be used to clean and filter digital data.</p>
